    <title>P4Merge Setup</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        From the <a href="https://www.perforce.com/downloads/visual-merge-tool">Perforce website downloads page</a> download the correct distribution
        of p4merge
        for your platform. It will ask you to register but you should be able to skip registration and just download. If you can't do this, make an
        account (you shouldn't need credit card info). The file should come down as <code>pv4.tgz</code>. Unpack the file with the
        following command <code>tar zxvf /path/to/p4v.tgz</code>, which should create a directory called <code>p4v-&#60;timestamp&#62;</code> in
        the same directory as the .tgz file. Go ahead and <code>cd</code> into the new directory and type <code>sudo mkdir /opt/p4v</code>
        followed by <code>sudo mv * /opt/p4v</code>. Finally type <code>sudo ln -s /opt/p4v/bin/p4merge /usr/local/bin/p4merge</code> to create
        a symbolic link from the binary executables directory in your PATH, to the executable p4merge file. You are all done installing p4merge. Yay!
        <br><br>
        To set p4merge as the default diff/merge tool for git, open the git config file by typing <code>nano /path/to/.gitconfig</code>
        (usually <code>nano ~/.gitconfig</code>), and simply add exactly the following lines to the file: <br>

        <blockquote>
            [merge] <br>
            &emsp; tool=p4merge <br>
            [diff] <br>
            &emsp; tool=p4merge <br>
            [mergetool "p4merge"] <br>
            &emsp; path=/usr/local/bin/p4merge <br>
            [difftool "p4merge"] <br>
            &emsp; path=/usr/local/bin/p4merge <br>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        Optionally add the following lines, which suppress in my opinion annoying prompts, and prevent unnecessary directory size proliferation: <br>
        <blockquote>
            [mergetool] <br>
            &emsp; prompt=false <br>
            &emsp; keepBackup=false <br>
            [difftool] <br>
            &emsp; prompt=false <br>
        </blockquote> <br>

        Test it out in a git managed project by making some changes and then compare the changes to the previous commit by typing
         <code>git difftool HEAD</code>
